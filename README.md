## Matrices

Matrices (plural for matrix) is a mathematical property/structure where lists of numbers are stored. They are used to perform a variety of important tasks in maths. 

A matrix will have a set number of complete rows and columns with numbers in it.

## Valid Matrices

A user of the program can enter a matrix into matrix.txt. To enter a matrix, it's form can look like the following

```
[
  1 0 1
  1 0 1
  1 1 1
]
```

As you can see, to write a valid matrix which can be parsed by the program, two corresponding square brackets need to be open with values which are spaced inside.
